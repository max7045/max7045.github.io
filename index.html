            <p class="headline">Kneeling during the national anthem</p>
            <p class="normal-text">It is tradition in sports that when the national anthem of a country is played, its athletes stand up to show allegiance to their country and their flag. 
                But what happens, when they don’t want to show allegiance because racism and police violence are so prevalent in their country that they no longer can stand behind its values?
            </p>
            <p class="normal-text">In the first two games of the NFLs Preseason in 2016 the San Francisco 49ers Quarterback Colin Kaepernick was seen not standing up while the national anthem was played.
                 Even though he wasn’t playing these two games, reporters started asking questions about his behavior, and when confronted with the question why he didn’t want to stand up during the national anthem, this was his reasoning:
            </p>
            <div class="quote-container">
                <p class="quote">“I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color, to me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. 
                    There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.”<br/>
                    <span>– Colin Kaepernick</span>
                </p>
                <img class="right-side-image"src="https://cdn.britannica.com/56/218756-050-E294EF1D/San-Francisco-49ers-football-Colin-Kaepernick-kneeling-2016.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p class="normal-text">The next week, Kaepernick decided to kneel down while “The Star-Spangled Banner” was played. In doing so he was joined by his fellow team member Eric Reid.
                This started some kind of movement, where many NFL players started to kneel down to protest racial discrimination and oppression. 
                This new form of protest called “taking the knee” got a lot of negative backlash and even former president Donald Trump commented, saying he would love to see NFL owners fire any athlete who kneels down during the national anthem.
            </p>
            <p class="quote">“Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. 
                Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!’””<br/>
                <span>– Donald Trump</span>
            </p>
            <p class="normal-text">
                Trump's harsh opinion on the topic had a lot of supporters who argued that showing this kind of disrespect to the US and their flag, dishonoring what their ancestors had built, shouldn't happen without consequences. 
                Furthermore the fact that there are soldiers oversea fighting for the US and their values was a major argument for critics of the athletes who were “taking the knee”,
                stating that disrespecting the flag and the USA while others are dying for this country and are trying to protect it, was a disgrace for the NFL and the whole country.
            </p>
            <p class="normal-text">Barack Obama expressed his concern about the topic by saying that, even though the message is very important and people should start to look at problems like racial discrimination, 
                police violence and institutionalized racism closer and try to change things, the way the athletes were delivering the message could distract people from Kaepernick's original intentions. 
                Thus instead of creating awareness for the real problems, the footballers were creating a new one by splitting the country in two groups, one saying that “taking the knee” is a legitimate way of peaceful protest and is an important way to show the underlying problems of racism in the US and the other one opposing these statements and criticizing that dishonoring the flag and the country is the wrong way to create awareness for these topics.
            </p>
            <p class="normal-text">In May 2018 NFL Clubs decided to fine players who were “taking the knee” during the national anthem, but allowing the players to stay in the locker rooms while “The Star-Spangled Banner” was played. 
                However some players like Eric Reid said that they will remain to kneel down, even if they get fined for doing so.
                <br/><br/>
                But where does “taking the knee” originate from?
